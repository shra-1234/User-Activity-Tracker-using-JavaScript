# User-Activity-Tracker-using-JavaScript
Using HTML and JS, we will create objects, functions, controls to get outputs logged in console.

Project Objective
==
Build a browser-based User Activity Tracker using pure JavaScript that demonstrates:
JavaScript fundamentals
Control flow
Functions & callbacks
Arrays & objects
Object destructuring
Loops
Prototype awareness
Console-based output (no UI frameworks)
Allowed Technologies
HTML
JavaScript (ES6+)
Browser DevTools Console
 No external libraries
 No frameworks
Project Requirements
PART 1 – Script Setup
Create an HTML file.
Connect JavaScript using:
Internal script for testing
External JavaScript file for main logic
All outputs must be logged in the console.
PART 2 – User Data Management (Objects)
Create a user object with the following properties:
id
name
age
email
isActive
Add a method inside the object that prints user details.
Log the object and inspect its prototype in DevTools.
PART 3 – Object Destructuring
Extract user properties using object destructuring.
Rename at least one destructured variable.
Use default values while destructuring.
Destructure the object inside a function parameter.
PART 4 – Activity Tracking (Arrays)
Create an array named activities.
Store multiple activity objects with:
activityName
timestamp
status
Loop through the array and print all activities.
Use:
push
pop
map
filter
PART 5 – Functions & Callbacks
Create a function that:
Accepts user data
Accepts a callback function
The callback should execute after processing user activity.
Demonstrate passing:
Named function
Arrow function as callback
PART 6 – Control Structures
Use if / else to check:
User age eligibility
Active / inactive status
Use switch to handle activity status.
Use ternary operator where applicable.
PART 7 – Loops Implementation
Use:
for loop to iterate activities
while loop for retry logic
do...while loop for at least one execution
Avoid infinite loops.
PART 8 – Operators & Data Types
Perform calculations using:
Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Compare values using:
Log data types using typeof.
PART 9 – Multiline Console Output
Print a formatted report using:
Backticks
Include:
User details
Activity summary
Status message
PART 10 – Prototype Awareness
Call at least one method on an object that was not explicitly defined.
Identify from where the method is inherited.
Log observations as comments.
FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
All output must be visible in the browser console
Code must be:
Readable
Well-structured
Commented where necessary
Use meaningful variable and function names
